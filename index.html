				<h1>A bit about me.</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>Hi, my name is Jin Young Bang, but call me Alex. I'm a South Korean who has lived in Thailand, Phuket, Bali, Indonesia, and now
					settled down in Boston University, studying computer science. Aside academics, I love playing sports with my friends especially
					volleyball, going to the gym, and listening to music (jazz, hip-hop, rnb, and many more).
				</p>
				<p>I know that challenging myself is an important part of growing as a programmer and thus, I try to learn something new everyday. I 
					spend time exploring the realms of programming and coding. I wholeheartedly believe that a combination of theory and practical 
					experience makes an amazing programmer, and I aspire to learn a multitude of theory in my university and also gain practical 
				experience in the real world.</p>

				<h2>Boston University</h2>
				<h3>B.A. in Computer Science, Expected May 2022</h3>
				<h4>Boston, MA</h4>
				<p>Currently, I am attending Boston University as a freshman, and throughout my time in BU, it has been such an amazing experience
					meeting new people, new city, and learning new things everyday. I was awarded Boston University's most prestigious merit scholarship,
					Trustee Scholarship, which provides full tuition for four years, and I am really grateful to all the people that has supported me 
					through my journey. This scholarship has allowed me to earn more freedom and time to pursue my interests and also take more risks
					in doing things I never have tried. So far, attending BU's Computer Science lectures has engaged me to learn more about programming, 
					and I want to exercise my creativity and practicality to strengthen myself as a programmer.

				<h2>Bali Island School (formerly Bali International School)</h2>
				<h3>International Baccalaureate Diploma, May 2018</h3>
				<h4>Bali, Indonesia</h4>
				<p>
					I attended Bali Island School when I was in Grade 3, and decided to graduate in this small, yet an amazing school. As BIS is a small
					school, this allowed me to engage in multiple of activities that I would have never tried. I was able to try out for multiple sports, 
					host my own conferences and competitions, help out in community service and also learn from amazing and respectful teachers. Throughout my
					10 years in BIS, my high school has allowed me to find my niche: to explore the realms of the application of math, and thus led me to choose
					majoring in computer science.
